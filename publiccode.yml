    shortDescription: >
      Routed is an app to help ambulances direct non-critical patients to hospital emergency rooms with the most availability.

    longDescription: >
      Our team was formed in February 2020 when Niels Tangherlini, EMS Operations Chief with the SFFD, reached out to Code for SF to help solve a problem he’d encountered for many years: how to help ambulances direct non-critical patients to EDs with the most availability.

      Since then, we’ve worked closely with the SFFD, as well as nurses, administrators, and IT departments from local hospitals to develop a working prototype of the platform.

      Today, we’re preparing to beta test the tool in the city of San Francisco.
