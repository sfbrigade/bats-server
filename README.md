# Routed Server

## Docker-based Development Setup

1. Download and install Docker for your platform

2. Clone this repo, copy the example.env file to .env and fill in empty variables, if any.

3. Run:

   ```
   docker compose up
   ```

   Wait a while for container images to download/build, then when everything is up
   and running, you can view the site in your browser:

   http://localhost:3000/

4. To log in to the running server container:

   ```
   docker compose exec server bash -l
   ```

   The development server will automatically set up the database on first startup.

   The test users include (email/password):

   batsadmin@c4sf.me/abcd1234 (a Superuser)

   op.healthcare@c4sf.me/abcd1234 (an operational Healthcare user)

   op.ems@c4sf.me/abcd1234 (an operational EMS user)

   If you wish to inspect the db, you can run:

   ```
   psql $DATABASE_URL
   ```

## Server Testing

1. Log in to a running server container as above.

2. Make sure the test database is created, and run migrations on it:

   ```
   cd server
   sequelize db:create --env test
   sequelize db:migrate --env test
   ```

   During development, you may be working on migrations and you will need to undo and rerun
   migrations- make sure to do that on the test database as well.

   ```
   sequelize db:migrate:undo --env test
   sequelize db:migrate --env test
   ```

3. Run the server tests:

   ```
   yarn test:server
   ```
